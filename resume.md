 3rd-year electrical engineering undergraduate with a focus in embedded systems and mixed-signal PCB design. Looking for opportunities to work at any level in an embedded system design chain .

## Experience

<!-- You have to wrap the "left" and "right" half of these headings in spans by
hand -->
### <span>PCB CAD Engineer, Ravata Solutions</span> <span>Feb 2020 - Present</span>

- Extensive analog circuit analysis of a bioimpedance sensing board with highly sensitive measurement requirements. Successfully identified and addressed multiple areas for optimization, improvement, and correction and lowered board cost by roughly 30%
- Wrote device firmware for an STM32F4 MCU and an accompanying stepper motor-based pump module. Employed debugging, ADC data collection, and hardware SPI/I2C/UART interfacing. Also wrote an accompanying python script to offload captured data via serial into a CSV file for postprocessing 
- High-volume design and optimization of many PCBs, including high-frequency (>1MHz) bioimpedance sensing motherboards, power management modules, and impedance sensor calibration chips

### <span>Electrical Team Lead, Space and Satellite Systems</span> <span>May 2020 -- Present</span>
- Leading team in designing CubeSat electrical system from the ground up (see my own technical contributions in the "Projects" section below)


### <span>Physics Tutor, UC Davis AATC</span> <span>Feb 2020 -- Present</span>
- Peer tutor for students taking lower division physics courses at UC Davis. Includes individual and group tutoring
- Topics range from classical mechanics to special relativity and quantum physics. Mathematics as advanced as multivariable calculus and complex differential equations are used

## Projects

### <span>CubeSat Electrical Bus</span> <span>Jan 2019-Present</span>
- Involved in technical work and leadership pertaining to the design of a 2U CubeSat out of UC Davis, with the core mission objective of being the first CubeSat team to demonstrate the repurposing of common hard disk drives as reacton wheels
 - Designed, laid out, and assembled PCBs for microsatellite actuators (reaction wheel motor driver, constant-current magnetorquer coil driver)
 - Assisted in the design of and performed the layout of the flight computer, based on a Raspberry Pi Compute Module and featuring a GPS, RTC, watchdog timer, and various sensors. Coordinated with software team on establishing communication bus setup
