Electrical engineering undergraduate with experience developing low-cost, 
mixed-signal embedded devices including circuit design, PCB layout, and firmware/software.
Currently seeking positions anywhere in the embedded design toolchain, where I can help 
develop reliable embedded solutions as quickly and cost-effectively as possible.

## Experience

<!-- You have to wrap the "left" and "right" half of these headings in spans by
hand -->
### <span>Embedded System Engineer, Ravata Solutions</span> <span>Feb 2020 - Present</span>

- Reduced product cost by roughly 50% by optimizing hardware selection for impedance
sensing circuit, as well as eliminating several expensive components by 
implementing digital signal processing of input and output sinusoids 
- Improved device prototype turnover and performance by switching to 4-layer 
circuit boards for critical modules and otherwise optimizing the PCB design 
toolchain
- Designed PCBs and wrote embedded firmware in C for real-time simultaneous ADC data processing, a stepper motor driver, and libraries for a variety of hardware peripherals
- Improved versatility and cost-effectiveness of system by designing host 
software for embedded medical device in Python, with full functionality 
including filesystem management and data transfer demonstrated on common 
PCs as well as Raspberry Pi

### <span>Physics Tutor, UC Davis AATC</span> <span>Feb 2020 -- Present</span>

- Peer tutor for students taking lower division physics courses at UC Davis
- Topics range from classical mechanics to special relativity and quantum 
physics, and includes electromagnetics

## Projects

### <span>CubeSat Electrical Bus</span> <span>Jan 2019-Present</span>

- Leading the electrical team in the design of UC Davis's first undergraduate
Cubesat mission
- Presented "Environmental and Performance Testing of Hard Disk Drives as 
Low-Cost Cubesat Reaction Wheels" at the UC Davis Undergraduate Research Conference 
in 2020
- Obtained amateur radio Technician license for validating AMSAT satellite transceiver
- Designed low-cost flight computer PCB based on Raspberry Pi Compute Module 3, 
featuring real-time-clock, hardware watchdog, and GPS.
