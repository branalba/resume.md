### <span>PCB CAD Engineer, Ravata Solutions</span> <span>Feb 2020 - Present</span>

- Extensive analog circuit analysis of a bioimpedance sensing board featuring constant current feedback (galvanostat) and highly sensitive measurement requirements. Successfully identified and addressed multiple areas for optimization, improvement, and correction.
  - Lowered board cost by advising removal of extraneous amplifiers, replacing a needlessly versatile demodulator with an equally precise combination of an analog multiplier and set of op-amps, and replacing instances of precision single op-amps with a comparable dual channel variant
  - Identified issue in galvanostat feedback functionality due to an overlooked phase shift of a 4-electrode sensor's excitation signal
  - Wrote firmware for the board using the STM32CubeIDE for an STM32F4 chip. Employed debugging, ADC data collection, and hardware SPI interfacing Also wrote an accompanying python script to offload captured data via serial into a CSV file for postprocessing
